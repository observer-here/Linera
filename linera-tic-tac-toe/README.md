# Linera Tic Tac Toe

A decentralized, real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built on the Linera blockchain platform. This project demonstrates the power of Linera's microchain architecture for building interactive, low-latency blockchain applications.

## 🎮 Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play against other players with instant move updates via WebSocket
- **Blockchain-Powered**: All game state and logic managed by Linera smart contracts
- **Player Statistics**: Track wins, losses, draws, and achievements
- **Modern UI**: Responsive React interface with smooth animations
- **Cross-chain Support**: Leverages Linera's message passing for multi-chain gameplay
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for smart contracts and frontend

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer (Rust + Linera SDK)
- **State Management**: Persistent game state using Linera's MapView storage
- **Game Logic**: Complete Tic Tac Toe rules with win/draw detection
- **Player Management**: Unique player tracking and statistics
- **Query Service**: Leaderboards and game history

### Backend Layer (Node.js)
- **REST API**: Game creation, joining, and move handling
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time game updates and notifications
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interfaces with Linera smart contracts

### Frontend Layer (React)
- **Game Board**: Interactive 3x3 grid with animations
- **Game Lobby**: Browse and join available games
- **Player Dashboard**: Statistics, achievements, and goals
- **Real-time Updates**: Live game state synchronization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Rust 1.70+ with wasm32 target
- Linera CLI tools
- PostgreSQL (for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd linera-tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   
   # Smart contract dependencies
   cd ..
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   createdb -h localhost linera_tic_tac_toe
   ```

4. **Deploy the smart contract**
   ```bash
   # Start Linera service (in separate terminal)
   linera service --port 8080
   
   # Deploy the application
   linera project publish-and-create
   ```

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start playing!

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Create or Join a Game**
   - Click "Create New Game" to start a new game
   - Or browse existing games and click "Join Game"

2. **Make Your Move**
   - Click on any empty cell to place your symbol (X or O)
   - The game alternates turns automatically

3. **Win Conditions**
   - Get three of your symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
   - If all cells are filled without a winner, it's a draw

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - View your statistics in the "My Stats" tab
   - Unlock achievements by playing games
   - Set and achieve personal goals

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Start all services first, then:
npm run test:integration
```
